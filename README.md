# Water-Hackathon-2021
All about my model, data and result visualization code is in my .ipynb files. The forecasting method used here is Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average, or SARIMA for short. The DQO forecast model predicts COD level (in mg/L) with RMSE=74.61, while SSV forecast model predicts volatile suspended solid level (in mg/L) with RMSE=6.56.

I saved all the neccesary plots to .png files for downloading.
